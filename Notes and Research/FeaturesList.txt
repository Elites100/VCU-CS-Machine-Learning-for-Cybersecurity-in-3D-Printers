Goal: Determine Features that can be used to describe the G-Code files


Note: When taking data different the parameters for each layer
IE: there a Min/Max temp for a specific layer

Temperature                                                                                                                                   .
Consistency of Max, Min, and Median of temperature for Extruder in each layer[o]
Determines Maximum and Minimum Temperature of the Bed and Extruder for the G-File
Check the Temperature for each Layer
M104 - Set HotEnd Temperature (Appears Near the End, slowly decreasing From Initial Temperature)
M109 -  Wait for HotEnd Temperature (should usually only appear start and finish) (UM3)

Fan Speed [o]
Determines the speed at which the fans blows and where they turn on and off
M106 fan on 
M107 fan off


Most Suitable Filament Type based on Temperature [o]
Determines the Minimum and Maximum Temperature of the Bed and extruder and determines a Filament Type that is most suitable to be used for this specific G-Code file.
M104 - Set HotEnd Temperature
M109 - Wait for HotEnd Temperature
T0/T1 - Select New Filament


Extruder & Movement                                                                                                                     .
Print range
Combination of minimum and maximum X, Y, and Z values
Occurance of G28 - homing 

Printer Head Movement Consistency [o]
Determine the consistency of the movement of the printer head on the x and y axis.
X - X-Axis Position
Y - Y-Axis Position
F - Extruder Movement Speed
G10 - Retract
G11 - Recover



Extrusion Speed, Distance, and Amount of FIlament Extruded[o]
Determines expected Speed and Distance Traveled by the Extruder and Amount of Filament Used.
X - X-Axis Position
Y - Y-Axis Position
Z - Z-Axis Position
E - Extrusion Amount
F - Extruder Movement Speed

Structure                                                                                                                                        .
Number of layers and Layer Height [o]
Every time you see a z-value change equal to the layer height, that indicates a new layer
Z - Z-Axis Position
E - Extrusion Amount
G10 - Retract Filament
G11 - Recover

Maximum Print Height and Print Width [o]
Determine the how tall the print will be based on Z-Value and Determine how wide the print will be
X - X-Axis Position
Y - Y-Axis Position
Z - Z-Axis Position
E - Extrusion Amount

Infill Pattern Structures [o]
Calculate the angle the printhead is moving to determine the type of infill structure (will not work with all types of infill structures)
Determines Irregularity in the Typical Infill Pattern Structures in each layer, such as layer thickness and extrusion amount
X - X-Axis Position
Y - Y-Axis Position
Z - Z-Axis Position
E - Extrusion Amount
F - Extruder Move

Print Time
 Based on distance / speed → so counting all G1 codes to total distance and speed is already set 

G-Code Instruction Appearance Consistency [o]
Determine the accuracy of how often and where certain G-code Instruction appears within a file.





Types of G-Code Attacks                                                                                                                .
Temperature Change of Extruder [X]
Temperature Change of Bed [X]
Change in Fan Speed [X]
Change in Speed of Extrusion Amount [X]
Change in Speed of Print Head [X]
Change in Layer Thickness [X]
Invalid parameters values  [X]
Erratic change in x and y movement (pushing print bed out of machine)  [X]
Gaps in printing (E0 retract filament) 
Unexpected pausing (G4 … ) 
Unusual M or G code combination 
Non-stop extrusion of filament  [X]
Inconsistent Layer Heights  [X]

What can be Figured out from G-Code
