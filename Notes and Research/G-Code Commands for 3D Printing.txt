G-Code Commands for 3D Printing

- In a .gcode file, each command is on a separate line and starts with a specific code.

G28 - Home Your Printer:

- Initiates the printer's homing sequence, moving it to known positions by touching endstops.
- Often used at the start of print files for a consistent starting point.
- Useful for moving an axis out of the way, like when removing a finished print.

Arguments:

- No arguments homes all 3 axes (X, Y, and Z).
- You can specify which axes to home by adding X, Y, or Z to the command.

Examples:

- `G28`: Homes all axes.
- `G28 X Y`: Homes X and Y axes.
- `G28 Z`: Homes only the Z axis.

G90 and G91 - Positioning Mode:

- G90: Absolute positioning, specify exact XYZ coordinates for movement.
- G91: Relative positioning, specify how far to move from the current location along an axis.
- G90 is common for absolute positioning, G91 for relative moves.
- Use M82 or M83 for extruder (E-axis) positioning.

Examples:

- `G90`: Use absolute positioning.
- `G1 X10 F3600`: Move to X=10mm on the bed.
- `G1 X20 F3600`: Move to X=20mm.
- `G91`: Use relative positioning.
- `G1 X10 F3600`: Move 10mm right from the current spot.

G1 - Move in a Straight Line:

- G1 is a common command for 3D printing.
- It tells the printer to move in a straight line to a specified spot.
- You can move one or more axes and control the extruder.

Arguments:

- Specify X, Y, or Z values for the position.
- Include an E value to control the extruder.
- Use an F value to set the movement speed in mm/min.

Examples:

- `G1 X0 Y0 F2400`: Move to X=0 Y=0 at 2400 mm/min.
- `G1 Z10 F1200`: Move Z-axis to Z=10mm at 1200 mm/min.
- `G1 X30 E10 F1800`: Extrude 10mm of filament while moving to X=30 at 1800 mm/min.

G92 - Set Current Position:

- Use G92 to set the current position of axes, often for the E axis (filament position).
- Overrides the current filament position for relative commands.
- Useful at the start of each layer or before filament changes.

Arguments:

- Specify the absolute coordinate for axes you want to change (X, Y, Z, E).

Examples:

- `G92 E0`: Set the current filament position to E=0.
- `G1 E10 F800`: Extrude 10mm of filament from the new position.

M104 and M109 - Extruder Temperature:

- Use M104 to start heating the extruder, and other commands can run alongside it.
- M109 waits until the extruder reaches the desired temperature before continuing.
- Ensures proper extruder temperature before printing.

Arguments:

- S value specifies the extruder temperature in Celsius.
- T value (optional) is for multiple extruders, specifying which one to control.

Examples:

- `M104 S190 T0`: Heat right extruder (T0) to 190°C.
- `G28 X0`: Home the X-axis while the extruder heats.
- `M109 S190 T0`: Wait for right extruder (T0) to reach 190°C before continuing.

M106 - Control Part Cooling Fan:

- M106 sets the speed of the part cooling fan (external fan cooling the print).
- Make sure to distinguish it from the extruder fan.
- Useful for adjusting cooling during printing.

Arguments:

- S value sets the fan speed from 0 (off) to 255 (full power).

Examples:

- `M106 S255`: Run the fan at full speed.
- `M106 S127`: Set the fan to around 50% power.
- `M106 S0`: Turn off the fan.
