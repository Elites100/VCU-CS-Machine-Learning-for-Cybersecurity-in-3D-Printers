| Statement of Work| Short Description of Project: Detecting potentially malicious alterations in the G-code file before its execution by the 3D printer is crucial. These alterations may involve adjustments to parameters like bed and extruder temperatures. Developing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) machine learning model that predicts whether future G-code files are malicious or benign based on extracted features could address this concern.|
|                  | Description of current state: The project is progressing as planned, focusing on developing parsers to extract data from G-code and convert it into a CSV format suitable for the machine learning model. This model comprises two parsers: one for modified (potentially malicious) G-code and another for unmodified versions. Additionally, the machine learning model is fully developed, utilizing an RNN with LSTM architecture. |
|                  | Value:  When constructing an RNN model aimed at detecting malicious G-code files based on their features, ethical considerations in AI and machine learning usage are paramount|
| Detailed Design | The parsers are designed to extract data from numerous G-code files, encompassing features such as Version, Layer, Fan status (on/off), Fan speed (minimum/maximum/average), temperature (minimum/maximum/average), FeedRate (minimum/maximum/average), and Layer height (average). These features are essential for the machine learning model. The parser structure will be implemented for both the modified (potentially malicious) and unmodified parsers.  |
| | The machine learning model is crafted to preprocess the CSV data and subsequently train and test the machine. Employing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, specifically selected for handling sequential data such as time series or text, enables the model to retain information across lengthy sequences. The model is configured for multi-class classification, converting raw outputs into probability distributions over the classes. Preprocessing steps entail loading and merging datasets, dividing the data into training and testing sets, reshaping input data, and encoding the target variable. In essence, the model will undergo training to forecast forthcoming G-code files by leveraging datasets comprising numerous test and train files. These datasets encompass features relevant to identifying potential malicious G-codes.  |
